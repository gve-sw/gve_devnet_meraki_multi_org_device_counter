## Prerequisites
#### Meraki API Keys
In order to use the Meraki API, you need to enable the API for your organization first. After enabling API access, you can generate an API key. Follow these instructions to enable API access and generate an API key:
1. Login to the Meraki dashboard
2. In the left-hand menu, navigate to `Organization > Settings > Dashboard API access`
3. Click on `Enable access to the Cisco Meraki Dashboard API`
4. Go to `My Profile > API access`
5. Under API access, click on `Generate API key`
6. Save the API key in a safe place. The API key will only be shown once for security purposes, so it is very important to take note of the key then. In case you lose the key, then you have to revoke the key and a generate a new key. Moreover, there is a limit of only two API keys per profile.

> For more information on how to generate an API key, please click [here](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/#!authorization/authorization). 

> Note: You can add your account as Full Organization Admin to your organizations by following the instructions [here](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Managing_Dashboard_Access/Managing_Dashboard_Administrators_and_Permissions).

## Installation/Configuration
1. Clone this repository with `git clone [repository name]`
2. Add Meraki API key inside config.py
```python
meraki_api_key = "API key goes here"
```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment. Make sure Python 3 is installed in your environment, and if not, you may download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python 3 is installed in your environment, you can activate the virtual environment with the instructions found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
4. Install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
First run the populate.py file that queries the organizations into a csv file and remove the rows of the organizations that you do not want to include when counting.

```
$ python3 populate.py
```

After orgs.csv is generated, now enter the command:

```
$ python3 main.py
```

After the script runs, it will generate a report (output.csv) on the different Meraki Device Models
